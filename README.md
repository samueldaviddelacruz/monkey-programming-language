# Writing an Interpreter in Go

Welcome to my project repository! This repository is a result of my journey through the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. As I followed along with the book, I delved into the fascinating world of building interpreters and gained valuable insights into how programming languages are designed and implemented.

## Project Overview

This project is a hands-on exploration of creating an interpreter from scratch using the Go programming language. Through the course of the book, I learned about lexical analysis, parsing, and executing code, gaining a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts in programming language theory.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Understanding Interpreters:** Gain insights into the inner workings of interpreters and how they transform code into executable instructions.
- **Go Language Proficiency:** Strengthen my proficiency in Go programming by applying language features and principles in a real-world project.
- **Practical Application:** Translate theoretical concepts into practical code, building a functional interpreter step by step.

## Current Progress

As of now, I have completed the initial chapters of the book, laying the foundation for the interpreter's structure and implementing basic lexical analysis functionality. This repository will serve as a platform to document my progress, share code snippets, and engage with fellow learners and enthusiasts.

I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration and discovery as we unravel the mysteries of interpreters together!
