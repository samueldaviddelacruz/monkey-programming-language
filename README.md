# Writing an Interpreter in Go

Welcome to my project repository, documenting my journey through "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. This endeavor is a deep dive into how interpreters work, designed to unravel the complexities of programming languages through the construction of an interpreter in Go.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a fully functional interpreter for a custom programming language. Following the guidance of the book, the goal is to gain a hands-on understanding of the inner workings of interpreters, from lexical analysis to parsing, all the way to execution, using Go's straightforward and efficient approach.

## Learning Objectives

- **Deep Dive into Go:** Leveraging Go's capabilities to parse and interpret a custom programming language.
- **Understanding Interpreters:** Exploring the components that make up an interpreter, including lexical analysis, parsing, and execution.
- **Practical Application:** Applying theoretical concepts in a hands-on manner to build a functional interpreter.

## Current Progress

As this project is in its early stages, here's what has been accomplished so far:

- Initial setup and planning of the interpreter structure.
- Beginning stages of lexical analysis for tokenizing our language.

I'll be updating this section as the project advances, providing insights into the development process and challenges encountered along the way.
