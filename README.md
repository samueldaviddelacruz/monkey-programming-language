# Writing an Interpreter in Go

Welcome to my project repository! This repository documents my comprehensive journey through "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. Through this project, I've embarked on a thorough exploration of building a fully functional interpreter from scratch using the Go programming language.

## Project Overview

This project encompasses the entire process outlined in the book, from laying the foundation for the interpreter's structure to implementing advanced features such as code evaluation and optimization. With a focus on practical application, I've not only gained a deep understanding of interpreters but also honed my Go programming skills along the way.

## Key Achievements

- **Complete Implementation:** I've successfully implemented the entire interpreter as outlined in the book, covering lexical analysis, parsing, and executing code.
- **Advanced Features:** In addition to the core interpreter functionality, I've explored advanced topics such as code evaluation and optimization, enhancing the interpreter's capabilities.
- **Code Evaluation:** Through rigorous testing and evaluation, I've ensured the reliability and functionality of the interpreter, applying best practices in software development.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my journey, including code snippets, explanations, and insights gained along the way.

## Next Steps

With the completion of the book, my journey doesn't end here. I'm currently diving into the next book from the same author, which focuses on building a compiler for the Monkey programming language. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to explore new projects and challenges in the realm of programming languages and compilers!.
